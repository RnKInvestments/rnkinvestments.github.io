			<h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
			<p>Many people are ether unaware, or are unable to take advantage of, or invest in, the vast opportunities that are available to them on the stock market, due to reasons like a lack of knowledge about the market, or the lack of commitment to manage and oversee the growth of their portfolio. That's why we at, R&K Investments, are willing to provide a service that requires us to do the managing and the overseeing, which will give the client ease of mind, and an opportunity to grow their wealth and their knowledge about this area of the financial market.</p>

				<h1>Our Projection/Goal</h1>
				<p>Through our sales strategies, and our hard work, we hope to gain 3 clients every quarter, which would mean 12 clients over a 12 month period.</p>
				<p>In a 2 to 3 year period, we hope to register as a LLC and gain 25+ clients.</p>
				<p>In a 5 to 10 year period, we hope to start our private company Assets/Investments and eventually stop taking individual clients.</p>
				<p>At first, there would be less focus on the revenue, and more on building relations with customers and building a well known reputation as a "Company People can Trust In".</p>
